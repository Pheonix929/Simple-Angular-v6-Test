## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

In order to get the app running, all that needs to be done is an "npm install" in the directory the package.json file is in and then an "ng serve" to start up the app.

You may see 6 vulnerability warnings, those are due to the dev versions of the libraries i am using, but running "ng serve" will run the app no problem.
